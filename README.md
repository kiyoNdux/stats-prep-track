# stats-prep-track

This repository is my personal journal of solving problems to build a strong foundation in **combinatorics, probability, and statistics**.  
The goal: prepare step by step until I can comfortably work through *Introduction to Probability* by Blitzstein & Hwang.

Each folder will contain:
- `problems.md` – problem statements  
- `solutions.md` – my worked-out solutions (LaTeX/Markdown)  
- `notes.md` – key insights, tricks, or mistakes I want to avoid

## Goals

- Build strong problem-solving skills in combinatorics & probability.  
- Gain confidence for tackling *Introduction to Probability* seriously.  
- Have a record of progress to reflect on later.
