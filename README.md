# ðŸ“Š stats-prep-track

This repository is my personal journal of solving problems to build a strong foundation in **combinatorics, probability, and statistics**.  
The goal: prepare step by step until I can comfortably work through *Introduction to Probability* by Blitzstein & Hwang.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure
Problems are organized by topic, following a progression from discrete math foundations â†’ combinatorics â†’ probability â†’ introductory statistics.

## âœ… Tracking Progress

Each folder will contain:
- `problems.md` â€“ problem statements  
- `solutions.md` â€“ my worked-out solutions (LaTeX/Markdown)  
- `notes.md` â€“ key insights, tricks, or mistakes I want to avoid  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build strong problem-solving skills in combinatorics & probability.  
- Gain confidence for tackling *Introduction to Probability* seriously.  
- Have a record of progress to reflect on later.

- **Books**:  
  - Blitzstein & Hwang â€“ *Introduction to Probability*  
  - Rosen â€“ *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications*  
  - Andreescu â€“ *102 Combinatorial Problems*  

- **Courses**:
