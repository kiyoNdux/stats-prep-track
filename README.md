# 📊 stats-prep-track

This repository is my personal journal of solving problems to build a strong foundation in **combinatorics, probability, and statistics**.  
The goal: prepare step by step until I can comfortably work through *Introduction to Probability* by Blitzstein & Hwang.

## 🗂 Structure
Problems are organized by topic, following a progression from discrete math foundations → combinatorics → probability → introductory statistics.

## 📅 Study Plan
I’m following a **16-week weekend-only roadmap** (2 hours Saturday + 2 hours Sunday).  
- **Weeks 1–8:** Combinatorics & counting principles  
- **Weeks 9–12:** Probability foundations (Bayes, conditioning, classic problems)  
- **Weeks 13–16:** Random variables, distributions, expectation, variance  

(Plan inspired by MIT 6.042J, Rosen’s *Discrete Math*, and Blitzstein & Hwang’s *Introduction to Probability*.)

## ✅ Tracking Progress
Each folder will contain:
- `problems.md` – problem statements  
- `solutions.md` – my worked-out solutions (LaTeX/Markdown)  
- `notes.md` – key insights, tricks, or mistakes I want to avoid  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong problem-solving skills in combinatorics & probability.  
- Gain confidence for tackling *Introduction to Probability* seriously.  
- Have a record of progress to reflect on later.
